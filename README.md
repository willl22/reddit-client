# Reddit Client App - NotReddit

Live site - https://dazzling-boba-e368a8.netlify.app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Description

This project was created as part of my Codecademy portfolio. It's a simplistic Reddit clone app which lists popular posts from Reddit, as well as their author, subreddit and comments (which can be toggled on or off).

## Features

Initially, the app displays posts from the /r/popular subreddit. You can search the listed posts for any which match your search. You can click the subreddit of a post to have the list change to posts only from that subreddit (reset by clicking the logo at the top of the page). You can view or hide the comments for each post by clicking the comment icon at the bottom right corner of each post.

While posts or comments are loading, a loading bar and animation will appear.

If there is an error displaying the posts, the app will display an error message and a button to take you back to the initial /r/popular list of posts.

There is a link on each post which takes you to the original post on Reddit.

The app is optimised to display responsively on different screen sizes.
